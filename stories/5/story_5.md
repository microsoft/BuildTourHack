A great opportunity has developed! We are invited to speak in the keynote of NoseCon 2017! The topic is how 3D and VR is helping us with rapid prototyping. We need to create a keynote demo for NoseCon that renders a Nose Prototype in 3D, or even in VR if we find the time. This is highly confidential.
